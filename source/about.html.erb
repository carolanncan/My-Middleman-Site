				<p>When I was looking over the list Dan provided, Middleman was actually where I wanted to start. I had previously completed the CodeAcademy tutorials and spent a few hours looking over Sass.</p>
				<br><p>That being said, it may explain why this was the hardest part of the process for me. I spent about 2-3 hours working to get my files set up correctly and to understand some of the nuances. I still have a short list of things I'm unsure about, and list of a few really simple things I wish I had known going in.</p>
				<br><p>It seems like the toughest problems to solve are the <em>really</em> simple problems. The things that are so basic and fudnamental that it's impossible to Google them.

				<p>I could probably count on my hand the amount of times I've used my command line - including watching ASCII Star Wars. So installing things from the command line, navigating through directories, remembering what directory I'm in before I install something... all took a little getting used to.</p>

				<p>Sass was a lot of fun to learn! After building one site, from scratch, with only CSS, I had developed a context for why you would want or need some of the things SASS offers and how to apply those things.</p>

				<p>There are some elements that I can see being more useful for a team of people building sites together, or building really large sites. For my practice building, it has been a little bit of a stretch to understand the full benefit of some of these mixins. But the more I play around with it, the more I really like using it.</p>
